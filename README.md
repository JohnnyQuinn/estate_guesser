# EstateGuesser

## Objective

The housing market in the United States is a peculiar thing. In California, the typical 3-bedroom home value is around $614,576 whereas in Ohio, the typical 3-bedroom home value is around $168,937 [(source)](https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/real-estate/cost-to-own-3-bedroom-home-every-state/) (The total difference being $445,639). This difference in prices across the United States makes it challenging to be able to understand or even estimate any given home’s value. 
Well this particular challenge, trying to estimate the most accurate home value, can be turned into a game. **Can you guess a home’s value just by knowing some of the basic info, location and looking at its pictures? That is the game of EstateGuesser.**
